# Bookmark Manager

## Task

This week's project is a bookmark manager. The goal is to expose the following aspects of web development:

* Acceptance testing: Capybara
* Relational databases
* Security considerations

A bookmark manager is a website to maintain a collection of links, organised by tags. You can use it to save a webpage you found useful. You can add tags to the webpages you saved to find them later. You can browse links other users have added.

The website will have the following functionality:

* Show a list of links from the database
* Add new links
* Add tags to the links
* Filter links by a tag
